Building JFLAP
--------------
Compiling and running JFLAP requires Java 1.4 and 1.5.  In order to
build JFLAP and the JAR, a Makefile has been provided.  To build JFLAP
with gnumake, enter

	make

from the command line.  This will create the compiled '.class' Java
files, as well as the JFLAP.jar executable jar file.  The script used to
create the JFLAP.jar executable requires Python 2.2.

To run from the class files:

	java JFLAP

To run as a JAR:

	java -jar JFLAP.jar

Alternatively on OS X and on a correctly configured Windows machine, you
can double click the JFLAP.jar file and it should just work.

JFLAPplet
---------
The demo.html page shows a very simple example of embedding JFLAP as an
applet, and requires that a JAR file for JFLAP be built as described
above.

Javadoc
-------
Entering

	make doc

will create Javadoc documentation for all the JFLAP code and packages in
the javadoc directory.  The javadoc that comes with the 1.4 SDK is
required.
